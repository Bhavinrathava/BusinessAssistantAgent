COPAY INFORMATION
- Copays typically range from $20 to $75 per visit depending on your plan
- Copays are due at the time of service
- Your specific copay amount can be found on your insurance card or by calling your insurance provider
- Some plans have separate copays for specialist visits vs. physical therapy

- Deductibles can range from $500 to $5,000+ depending on your plan
- We can help you understand your deductible status before beginning treatment

COMMON QUESTIONS

Q: Do I need a referral to see a physical therapist?
A: Most states, including ours, have direct access laws allowing you to see a PT without a referral. However, some insurance plans still require one for coverage. We'll verify this for you.

Q: How many visits will I need?
A: Treatment duration varies based on your condition, goals, and progress. Most patients see significant improvement within 6-12 visits. We'll discuss a personalized treatment plan during your evaluation.

Q: What should I bring to my first appointment?
A: Please bring your insurance card, photo ID, referral (if applicable), and any relevant medical records or imaging results.

Q: Will my insurance cover my treatment?
A: Physical therapy is covered by most insurance plans for medically necessary conditions. We verify your specific benefits before your first visit and discuss any estimated out-of-pocket costs with you.
